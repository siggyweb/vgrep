# vgrep
`vgrep` is a dynamic or layer 2 terminal which sets above the shell, and manages command execution through an 
application that dynamically renders the results of commands in the terminal, allowing rapid feedback and tuning of 
commands that are complex or need to be used repetitively.

# # Shortcuts
- "ctrl+c" exit the vgrep dynamic terminal.
- "ctrl+q" copy the results from the view directly to the clipboard.
